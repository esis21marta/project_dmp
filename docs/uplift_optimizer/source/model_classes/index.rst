Model Classes
=============

Here are the different models for both classification and regression uplift modelling:

- T-Learner model. Read more on `Uplift model <https://tsdmp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/499154945/A+quick+introduction+to+uplift+modelling>`_
- Attentive model. Read more on `Attentive model <https://tsdmp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/717815809/Attentive+Models+Introduction>`_
- Propensity-based model. Read more on `Propensity model <https://tsdmp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/552894752/Propensity+models+-+what+are+those>`_
- Binary uplift model (classification only). Read more on page 28 of `this link <https://www.slideshare.net/PierreGutierrez2/beyond-churn-prediction-an-introduction-to-uplift-modeling>`_

You can find below the details of these models and of the utility class for scoring with MLflow.
